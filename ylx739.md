I am Ian Burns, and I am a junior here at the University of Tennessee. I am a computer engineering major, looking forward to graduating in 2025. I am interested in the
fields of software engineering, hardware engineering, and AI/Machine Learning. Outside of my academics, I enjoy playing and watching soccer, as well as watching the
Tennesssee Volunteers.
